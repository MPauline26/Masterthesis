\textbf{Statutory Declaration}
\end{center}

\vspace{1cm}

I hereby declare

that I have abided by the rules of academic work, in particular that I have authored the master thesis independently and have not availed myself of any sources other than the ones specified in the appended bibliography. All passages taken from other publications word for word or in substance are identified as such. I further declare that I have not yet submitted this master thesis as academic work in any form, neither in Austria nor abroad.

I am aware that also after positive assessment of the master thesis, discovery of a violation of the rules of academic work (especially in case of plagiarism) will result in the initiation of proceedings to declare both the assessment as well as the academic degree granted null and void.
